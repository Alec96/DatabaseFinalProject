Squat start with an obvious jug (flexes so pull down) and a right foot way out right and pop up to the crack with your right hand. Bring your left hand up and match in the crack. Step up to the starting jug and cross right hand to next crimp (bad). Left hand to bad undercling, then move feet, bump left hand to crimp below topout, move up feet into the crack and grab those slopers. Moving from the crack to the crimps and then the lip is the short crux.  Get a heel and mantle for all you\'re worth.  Make sure you climb up the back side to brush off pine needles.

More technical than powerful, but classic either way.','East side of Ride the Lightning boulder.','Pads and spotters.',6,3.3,1,NULL,NULL),
(3,'Vintage','Fun moves on big edges and pinches take you through some dikey and potentially loose rock to the top of this blunt arete. Height and jumbled landing conspire to warrant a highball designation.','Vintage is the arete left of the obvious finger crack known as Warrior.

Tension and good footwork get you to the jugs. Keep calm because the jugs get smaller at the top.','About 20 feet left of Storm Pockets on the Storm Boulder. Starts on the hollow flake below a little roof.','A couple pads and at least two competent spotters. The landing is good, but the topout is heady.',8,3.4,1,NULL,NULL),
(5,'Mr. Natural','Sit-start on a thin crescent-shaped flake.  Move up thru decent edges and bulbs on the steep wall with keen footwork to a series of sharp diagonal crimps.  As the chalk disappears and the holds get worse, find your way to the top with inconspicuously small edges on the steep slab.','Lower (east) Storm Boulder - south face, right side.  Just left of the arete.','Pads and spot',9,3.3,1,NULL,NULL),

Follow the overhanging crack to the right with good feet.  Just past the tree, slot your L hand into a vertical crack, grab a bad crimp on the R face, and dyno R hand to the lip (crux).

(9,'Warrior','This is the impressive right-diagonalling finger crack that splits the face between two arete problems. Good locks once you find them, though the crack is often wet.  "Graham O" feel that "This classic problem is a test of crack climbing and mental fortitude. Though obvious, aesthetic, and appealing, few decide to attempt it after seeing the landing. Those who decide to try it will be rewarded, as it is very unique for Pway and gives a New England climber a taste of the Buttermilks.','The boulder directly to the right if you\'re standing at Storm Pockets. The top of the boulder is a bit of a jungle. Downclimb with the help of a tree.', 'Multiple pads and at least one capable spotter.',3,3.2,1,NULL,NULL),
(10,'Mothra Stewart Left','A fun variation to a classic climb. Start as for Mothra Stewart but once you make the long reach and the hard match keep moving left for another move or two and make a huge iron cross to a far jug (crux) from there continue straight up the face on some smaller holds and topout high off the deck.','Same start as for Mothra Stewart. Located on the backside of the Ride the Lightning boulder.','3 or 4 pads, spotters.',9,3.3,1,NULL,NULL),
(11,'Polish Terrorist','Sit start of Terrorist.   Edited to Add 9-12-07. Thank you Tristan Perry.  The start is extreme lowball (scary, you\'re almost lying down) and it\'s really hard to pull off the ground, let alone get on with the rest of the problem. That is by far the hardest move on the entire problem. Small but positive crimps follow up and right to the rest of the Terrorist to gain the starting stance for Terrorist.','On the left end of the Storm Boulder if you\'re facing Ride the Lightning','One or two pads, and a competent spot will make you feel better about the mantle/slabby top.',9,3.1,1,NULL,NULL),
(12,'Terrorist Left','The left version of Terrorist. Although they share the same name, this climbs like an independent line. If you like Terrorist, you\'ll like this line too. Another bit of Pawtuckaway trickery.   Start on the chalked jug left of Terrorist that Squeeze Play starts on and head straight up. There\'s an obvious good spot on the arete/lip. Get your feet up, and from here figure out how the heck you\'re going to get onto the slab (crux).','To the left of Terrorist. If you\'re looking at Ride The Lightning, go to the left around the same boulder and find the really chalked up jug next to a tree on the face.','Pads, a spotter wouldn\'t hurt either.',5,2.8,1,NULL,NULL),
(13,'Blaow','Start high on two crimps above head height (they are bad!!) Deadpoint all points off to jug up and left. It looks possible, but it isn\'t.  For a V5 boulderer I have decent crimp strenght. I can support my body weight on these crimps and pull up with feet on, but man i can\'t imagine what kind of training it would take for me to feel confident dyno-ing off these crimps.','Left of Ride the Lightning, right of Terrorist.','Pad and spotter strong enough to catch you, so you can commit.',10,2.9,1,NULL,NULL),
(14,'Brett\'s Mom','Sit start on a good hold in the crack just right of the tree (same as for Glass Blower (aka Pygmies & Cornrolls)). Move up to a smiley face edge. A big move to a sloping rail over the lip, move right and up for the tough mantle (find a crimp for success!). Dynamic, delicate, fun!','On the Storm boulder to the right of Ride the Lightning. Starts in the group of trees.','Pad and a spotter',10,2.8,1,NULL,NULL),
(15,'Evolution','Pull on from small crimps at about 6\' high, both of which are from a small flake.  There is a small rail for both of your feet.  Make a big fun move to the right onto another small crimp at the top of a flake.  Work your way up that flake and reset your feet on the face below you.  Throw really big again to the right, aiming for a sloper.  Matel onto the less steep terrain (crux) and climb the easy slab topout.  There is a sit start which I was told is V11, it\'s all yours.','Just past ride the lightning and the terrorist, on the next boulder close to the trail.  You will be facing the same direction as the aforementioned climbs about 50 feet away.','a few pads and spotters, I wouldn\'t want to do this one alone.',6,2.2,1,NULL,NULL),
(16,'Downward Spiral','The extended start to Ride the Lightning.  Squat/sit start with two holds in the crack and a good right foot.  Make a big move left to grab a sloper, drop right hand into the left start hold, then work your feet left.  Match the sloper (crux) and move to a jug or an undercling before grabbing the holds of RTL.  Finish on RTL.  The moves can be fun, unfortunately, the problem is wet most of the time.  It is rare to find it in climbable condition.','From Ride the Lightning, move right about 10 feet.  The start of this problem is in the grove of trees.','Pads & spotters',8,2.5,1,NULL,NULL),
(17,'Blaow\'s Cousin','A cool variation on a crimp testpiece. Start as for Blaow on two small crimps. Find your feet and instead of dynoing to the jug straight up, cross up and right to the cool sidepull pinch. Fire up and right to some better crimps then top \'er out.   A sweet jump start variation goes to this at about v7. Start holding the right starting crimp, find out which foot you want to keep on the ground, then jump and catch the sidepull pinch with your left hand. Finish up the same way.','If you are looking at Ride The Lightning, look to the left and find the two chalked up horrendous crimps. These are the start holds for Blaow and Blaow\'s Cousin.','2 pads, a spotter is recommended as there is a tree that the climber could potentially hit if they blow the upper moves.',10,2.7,1,NULL,NULL),
(18,'Monkey Press','This mantle problem can be downright embarrasing seeing as how it\'s only 4 feet off the ground but more difficult than the topout of Ride the Lightning.  Sit start on large jugs at the lip of the roof and you\'ll notice there aren\'t any feet.  Swing a heel out left, then use a very thin crimp up and left to press it out and standup.  This can be fun to watch, but pray nobody is looking if you get spanked.','On a small boulder that forms a roof between Terrorist and Vintage.  If you\'re standing in front of Terrorist, look to your left towards the other Storm Boulder.  You\'ll see the low roof.','Pad',3,1.7,1,NULL,NULL),
(19,'The Three Graces','This is the obscure and slightly more difficult right variation of Ride the Lightning.  Start as for Ride the Lightning and get both hands up to the crack.  Rather than move left along the crack, undercling the top of it and bust straight up to a tiny crimp below the lip with your right hand.  Snag the lip and move left to pull the mantle.','Find the obvious arching crack that is Ride the Lightning and you\'ve found this climb.  Downclimb off the back down the easy slab.','Pads & spotter',6,2.4,1,NULL,NULL),
(20,'Innovator','This tricky arete is either super crimpy or powerful depending on your beta.  Either way, sit start with a good knob/jug for your left hand and your right on a small crimp.  Pull off the ground and get your right foot up below your right hand before dropping into a sidepull/undercling crimp.  Now you can either throw for a good rail or bump up slopers/crimps to get there slower.  Once you get your foot up on the starting jug, the climbing gets easy.  Finish up the arete to the top.','On the other large boulder across from Terrorist, next to the trail.  This problem is on the trail side, right next to Revolution and Evolution.

(21,'Mothra Stewart Variation','Left of the Mothra Stewart start is another super hollow flake that feels like it\'ll rip out.  The sit start starts here. Otherwise, I started out with my left hand here and my right hand up on a good sidepull. Crank up to a crumbly crimp and make your way right into Mothra Stewart and finish on the climb.  This guy is less reach dependent than the original and therefore more shorty friendly. If you\'re not tall enough to ride Mothra Stewart, check out the variation and have your ogre sized buddies do the original.','Look low for a hollow flake way left on the storm boulder left of Mothra Stewarts original start.','pads and spotters.',7,2.3,1,NULL,NULL),

(23,'Storm Traverse','A cool sloper traverse that scales the appealing sloping arete from the very right side of the Mothra Stewart headwall all the way to the Storm Pockets topout. A fun problem that shares the crux with it\'s classic neighbor (storm pockets), which will feel even harder after all the pump. A good problem worth doing if you like this sort of thing.','Starts on the far right side of the lip of that is the top of the face home to Mothra Stewart. It trends left from there and tops out same as Storm Pockets.','A few pads side by side. A spotter would be helpful but not required.',4,2,1,NULL,NULL),
(24,'Pikachu','A fun problem that be climbed with long power moves or with short beta intensive trickery.   Start on a neat sloper/knob thing poking out of the rock that has a good ridge in it and a sloper to the right of this. Follow the lip to the left by slapping along slopers and some good crimps until you reach the little peak of the lip. From here, find the holds you wanna use and pull a tough mantle. Run up to the top.  Here\'s a video of the problem: youtube.com/watch?v=Ov58IrL…','This is to the right of Zap. If you\'re looking at Ride The Lightning, walk right around the boulder until you see a almost perpetually wet part of the crack. There is a boulder to your right. You should be looking at Pikachu from this point.','2 pads and a spotter to move one. 3 pads is better.',2,1.7,1,NULL,NULL),

(26,'Revolution','A one move wonder.  Sit start with a crimp/gaston for your left hand and a small but good flake for your right.  The feet are decent, but once you pull off the ground, dyno with every bit of energy you can find (steal it from other people if you need to) and latch a crimp somewhere around 7\' up.  Using another crimp and a jug up and left, topout through the groove.','On the other big boulder across from Terrorist, this problem climbs/dynos out the side closest to the trail.

(29,'Further Down The Spiral','The extended sit start to The Three Graces.  Essentially this is Downward Spiral with the alternate ending.  Start as for Downward Spiral in the grove of trees with two holds in the crack and bust left to the perpetually wet sloper.  Continue left into the start of The Three Graces and finish it up.  As with Downward Spiral, if it\'s dry, climb it because it might be your only chance!','From Ride the Lightning, move right about 10 feet. The start of this problem is in the grove of trees.','Pads & spotter',8,1.5,1,NULL,NULL),

(31,'The Wizard','This is a never-done crimp problem that tackles the blunt prow directly below the topout of \'Pygmies and Cornrolls\'. It\'s incredibly sharp and I highly recommend avoiding it unless you are desperate for a tick and even then I feel that you should think about it.  Sit start on a good RH sidepull and bad LH crimp. Bump your right to a sharp crimp, and decide how much you want the send. Do you want it so bad that you would be willing to lose enough skin/blood that you would be out for the day? If so, than continue onward! Jump for a good crimp, and keep an eye on your fingers as they start to throb and bleed. It\'ll feel like crimping a katana. Hit the slopey crack before jumping to the lip. Topout same as Pygmies and Cornrolls, and curse yourself for ever attempting this god-forsaken pile o\' pain.','The blunt prow directly below the topout of Glass Blower.','A few pads and a spotter who is capable of driving you to the hospital if you get arthritis.',8,0.5,1,NULL,NULL),

(33,'Tesa','A link-up between two classics. Sit start same as Mr. Natural on the cool incut flakes and traverse left on some chossy flakes to the start of Warrior and finish up Warrior. Awkward and chossy and sharp, but still includes all of the Warrior. A climb that would otherwise be a bomb (the first section) and a climb that would otherwise be a four star (the Warrior part) combined evens out at two stars, I guess.','Starts same as Mr. Natural and traverses into Warrior','As much pro as you would need for Warrior (4 pads and 2 spotters minimum) plus two or so pads for the traverse.',9,0,1,NULL,NULL);
